On a high level the game is a 2.5D survivor game where the player has to survive waves of enemies and bosses. The player can choose between different characters, each with their own unique abilities and weapons. The player can also upgrade their weapons and abilities by collecting resources from the enemies they defeat.

I was responsible for designing and implementing the core gameplay mechanics, weapon system, and powers draft. I also handled the deploymenten and CI/CD pipeline for the game.
