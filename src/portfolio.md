## [Stay Dead](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3856830/Stay_Dead/)

STAY DEAD is a fast-paced roguelite game where you play as a zombie fighting back against an army of enemy robots. The game features procedurally generated levels, linear story progression, and a variety of playable characters and abilities to help you survive.

Still in development, the game is set to release in 2026 on Steam for PC, switch, and other platforms.

At a high level, the game is a 2.5D survivor game where the player must survive waves of enemies and bosses. Players can choose between different characters, each with unique abilities and weapons. They can also upgrade their weapons and abilities by collecting resources from defeated enemies.

I was responsible for designing and implementing the core gameplay mechanics, weapon system, and power drafts. I also handled the deployment and CI/CD pipeline for the game. The game was developed in Unity and deployed to WebGL. Additionally, I managed the integration with the blockchain, client-server communication, and data security(because of hacking issues).
