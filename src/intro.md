# Introduction

This site is meant to be a small documentation repository and to showcase my resume.
Maybe I will add some blog posts, or wasm builds, in the future.

## About me

I am a game developer with a passion for game design and programming.  
I have experience with C, C++, C#, and Unity, and I am currently learning Rust and Unreal.  
Besides that, I am a Git aficionado, and I have experience with Perforce and SVN.  
I know the basics of web development, and I am currently learning about CI/CD, DevOps and a bit of backend development.
