# Cover Letter Pedro Soares

Dear Hiring Manager,

I have over five years of experience in software engineering and game development,
I have a strong background in creating engaging user experiences, particularly
in projects like "[Chibi Survivor](https://chibi.gg/sso?app=survivor)"
and "[The Littles](https://playside.thelittles.io/arcade?near=portalFromArcadeToPlayside)."

At Kuma Games, I led the development of "Chibi Survivor," focusing on
innovative gameplay mechanics and user engagement. My work on "The Littles"
involved creating high-performance mini-games that received recognition as
one of the top play-to-earn browser games. My proficiency in technical design and game development give me a unique perspective on creating user focused applications.

I am eager to bring my skills in agile development and collaboration to your projects.  

Thank you for considering my application.  
I look forward to discussing how I can contribute to your team.

Best regards,  
  
Pedro Soares
